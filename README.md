# civ5-multi-agent-simulation
This is my first attempt at building an AI for Civilization V that improves the game's decision-making using MCTS and RL (initially). The goal is to create an AI that makes better strategic and tactical decisions than the default Civ V AI.

Since this is my first go at this kind of project, any feedback, contributions, or advice are highly appreciated!
